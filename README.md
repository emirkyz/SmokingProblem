# SmokingProblem

This is a smoking problem solution with semaphores and threaads. 

Problem says that there is table and friends sitting around the table. One guy puts paper and match to table
                                                                       One guy puts paper and tobacco to table
                                                                       One gut puts match and tobacco to table
                                                                       
Whenever there is atleast 1 of each material, one of the guys make cigar.
Right now my solution doesn't involve one of the guys smoking, my method creates another person who smokes. In near future I am gonna re-write it so the 	distributors will be smoking
